PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Steve now has lots of customers and now some customers are starting to get
evening snacks after children return from school, so the customers are unhappy
and Steve is slowly losing them. Steve promises to fix this situation and with profits
made so far buys more scooters and delivery persons. Steve is worried if this will
work, so we need to modify the program to help Steve with figuring out delivery
slots with multiple scooters now.
