PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Steve after walking thru the location is confident about prospects of pastry
business in Saibaba colony and has finalized the location of Pastry cloud kitchen.
Steve is very risk averse so Steve advertised pre-order for Pastry to be delivered
as evening snack. Steve has hired one delivery person and has a scooter with a
modified carrier. Based on the day's orders he wants to communicate the delivery
slots to his customers. Since the scooter carrier has finite capacity and customers
may order cupcakes, birthday cake, bread etc We are tasked with writing a
program that will allow Steve to enter all orders for the day and we create different
slots. We want to make sure we can fill the scooter carrier to max possible capacity
and also conserve petrol by making each drop slot cover a minimum distance.
Goal is reduce number trips and total distance traveled.
