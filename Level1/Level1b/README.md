PROBLEM STATEMENT :

Steve initially gets only a few orders per day after lots of advertising and giving
samples in grocery shops in the area. Business has started to expand but has
reached a saturation point in these areas. So Steve is considering expanding to
the adjacent Sivananda colony using the same person and scooter we need to
now recommend possible routes and slots for this bigger area Steve wants to
operate.
